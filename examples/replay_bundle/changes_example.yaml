# Override thresholds
thresholds:
  max_highs: 5              # Allow up to 5 high severity issues
  max_total_points: 200     # Increase total points threshold
  max_highs_with_override: 10

# Override severity weights
severity_weights:
  HIGH: 25.0               # Reduce HIGH weight from 50.0
  MEDIUM: 5.0              # Reduce MEDIUM weight from 10.0

# Override category weights
category_weights:
  ui: 0.5                  # Reduce UI weight
  security: 3.0            # Increase security weight
  build: 1.0               # Reduce build weight

# Suppress specific findings
